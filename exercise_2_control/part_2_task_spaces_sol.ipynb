    "### Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the robot used is 7 degrees-of-freedom robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2.1 See the code below.  In this solution, the code is further adapted to store the joint space velocies and task space velocities for further analysis.\n",
    "  -  Different types of pose-errors and their corresponding Jacobian are discussed in the slides of  Lecture 3 (task_space_control.pdf, starting from slide 5).\n",
    "  -  2.1.1 using the pseudo-inverse approach goes wrong at a certain time near the end.  What happens is a singularity or near-singularity that causes very high\n",
    "     joint velocities.  For these very high velocities our control frequency is not sufficient and the linearization using $\\mathbf{J} \\dot{\\mathbf{q}}$ is not a good approximation any more,leading to erroneous results.\n",
    "  -  2.1.2 uses the damped least squares pseudo-inverse to resolve this issue at the cost of not completely achievening task space velocity near the singularities.  Near the singularities, the robot is going to deviate from the task space velocities in order to reduce significantly the joint space velocities.  The code below has added plots related to the joint space velocities and its magnitude and the task space velocity and its magnitude.  \n",
    "  The result is compared to the theoretical upper bound from lecture 3.  The task space velocities come from both feedback and feedforward.  The feedback \n",
    "  component is larger here, since the task space velocities are not completely achieved due to the singularity and the dls-pseudoinverse.\n",
    "  - 2.1.3 (see code) we used task space weighting to indicate that we find position more important than orientation.  Near singularities the robot is going to deviate mostly in orientation, and much less in translation.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- 2.2 When the target moves out of the end-effector's range, the Jacobian matrix becomes singular or nearly singular (ill-conditioned). In this case, small desired velocities in the task space lead to excessively large joint velocities. The damping term $\\mu$ alleviates this by adding a small positive value to the singular values of the Jacobian, preventing very high task space velocities. The damping can also be interpreted as adding regularization to the least squares problem. A small $\\mu$ allows for good tracking but may still be unstable in singular configurations, whereas a large $\\mu$ improves stability at the cost of increased tracking errors.\n",
    "- 2.3 The damped least squares approach does not explicitly prioritize position or orientation, since both is weighted equally. However, due to the difference in units between position and orientation, the orientation is implicitly prioritized more than the position (i.e., an orientation error of 1 rad is equal to a position error of 1 m).\n",
    "- 2.4 By weighting the position more than the orientation, it is possible to prioritize the position error.\n",
    "- 2.5 Similar to part 1:\n",
    "    - 2.5.1 When there is no feedforward, tracking errors occur because the controller only corrects errors after they appear.\n",
    "    - 2.5.2 When there is no feedback, the robot moves, but the initial error is not corrected, and the robot drifts further from the desired trajectory due to unmodeled dynamics. In the regions near singularities, the task space error gets larger and will never be corrected in the motion afterwards.  The feedback\n",
    "    not only serves to correct for disturbances of the robot, also to correct numerical errors due to integration, closeness to singularity, etc...\n",
    "- 2.6 Look at the controller provided in part 3.\n",
