    "### Part 1: motion planner\n",
    "In part 1, the assignment consited of designing a motion planner to generate a reference path or trajectory to move the robot from configuration A to a configuration B. Both configurations could be of own choice. The motion planner had to consists three essential parts: an optimization-based local motion planner, a collision checker and a global motion planning using the probabalistic roadmap (PRM) algorithm.\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "The program above works as follows:\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "The execution of the program starts by initializing a few parameters like the robot radius (to avoid collision, calculated from the URDF file), starting point, goal coordinates, seed number (for random obstacle generation), number of random nodes (for PRM algoritm) and number of neighbors to connect to (for PRM algoritm). The initial position of the robot, the obstacles and the system boundaries are vizualized. Then, the defintions of the the implemented functions and classes follow, after which the execution of the motion planner can start. The obstacles (walls and random generated obstacles) are saved to be accessble by the collision checker.\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "The MotionPlanner is initialized, this consists of:\n",
    "* Generating a roadmap using the PRM algorithm:\n",
    "  * Generating 1000 sample points. These sample points are only kept if they are accesible by the robot, i.e. the euclidian distance from the sample coordinates to the nearest obstacle is smaller than the radius of the robot. This way the robot can access every sample point in every possible pose.\n",
    "  * Connecting the nodes with edges if the local planner can find a path between the two nodes without collision with any of the obstacles. \n",
    "  * Using the Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortes path (in euclidian distance) form START to GOAL. This generates the global path. This path consists of waypoints, i.e. nodes that are connected by an edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "* When the global path is created, the local planner can use these waypoints to generate a reference trajectory. This is the path the robot should follow if there was no model mismatch. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Now, the controller comes into play. The robot starts at its initial position and the local planner finds a path to the next waypoint. The local planner returns the optimal velocity $v$ and rotational velocity $\\omega$ to execute the found path.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The output from the controller is passed into the simulator functions, which \"executes\" the movement for one 0.1 $s$. Then, the new position and next waypoint are given back to the motion planner, which checks if the robor is near the current goal waypoint. If the robot is, the next waypoint becomes the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "* These steps loop until the robot is at the GOAL waypoint, after which the simulation stops.\\\n",
    "\n",
    "When implementing en testing this pipeline, some issues were found and adressed.\n",
    "For the motion planner, the following design choices were made:\n",
    "1) The goal $\\theta$ was not penalized because the distance between two waypoints was too short. The optimizer had to find extreme values to find a suitable path. If for example, two way points are very close but the goal angle was orthogonal to the initial angle, the robot had to take a big detour to end in the goal angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) To find if their was a path between two nodes (during the roadmap generation), the initial orientation ($\\theta$) was chosen to be the direction of the line that connects the two nodes. This way, we could be certain there was a possible path between the two nodes. Because the robot has a two parallel wheel differential drive, the robot can turn in place. So it can always take on the right pose before advancing. This means, even when the robot was faced towards a wall with an obstacle directly behind it, it could still navigate out of it by turning 90° first. With this approach, all possible positions and paths could be found in the roadmap generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) The issue above also had to be addressed in the motion planning when using the local planner during simulation. A partial solution was to check the orientation at the start. If the angle between the starting orientation and the line form start to next waypoint was more than 11.5°, the robot would first turn in place until the angle was below 11.5°. After advancing, the local planner calculates the optimal path every 0.1 $s$. This meant reference trajectories like the ones below in the center graph, are smoothened out. This happens because the local planner only calculates the path between the the current position and the next waypoint. So when the robot turn in place and makes a small angle with the direction to the next waypoint, the calculated local path is just a straight line. \n",
    "\n",
    "4) As the middle graph in the picture below also shows, because the roadmap generator uses optimal starting angles to find collision-free paths and when the actual orientation of the robot is orthogonal to this optimal angle, this can cause issues in the actual reference path generation. This issue is again solved with the use of the initial rotation in place mention above.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) The bounds for the optimizer in the local planner were limited because unlimited bounds (which also can cause extreme velocities and angular velocities) caused \"glitching\" of the robot. In some situations, it found two equal solutions (two half circles) because the robot can go forwards and backwards. This issue was further addressed by checking the angle of the current pose of the robot. If the front was more faced towards the next goal, the initial velocity guess was positive. If the back was faced towards the goal, a negative initial velocity was guessed. \n",
    "\n",
    "6) As the first graph in the picture below shows, sometimes the shortes path was not found. In the graph below, the passage around coordinate (-0.75, -2.5) was large enough for the robot to be able to pass. However, because of the random sampling, if the two nodes were not close enough or not low enough, the path was not found. This can possibly be improved by using more samples.\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Because the robot can rotate in place, the reference_trajectory function was later added. Instead of just finding the path from the initial pose, if no collision-free path was found, try finding a path with the robot rotated 90°.\n",
    "\n",
    "8) The local planner uses SLSQP (sequential least squares programming). This is a popular optimization method for constrained non-linear problems. It's a great choice in this situation because this optimizer handles non-linear dynamics and the low number of constrains well. $1$\n",
    "\n",
    "9) The motion planner switching the next goal/waypoint whenever the robot gets into a radius of 0.2 (euclidian distance) of the current goal/waypoints. This way, the trajectory of the robot is smoothened and the nearby waypoints can be handled as one.\n",
    "\n",
    "10) Later, the code was adjusted to implement the following change: instead of still making a refence path even when a collision occurs (as you can see in the image above), return an empty path. This way, it was certain that collisions would be avoided. this came with the following problem: now some sample points that are visitable by the robot are only visitable in a certain direction (parallel to the wall) because otherwise, the robot could not turn fast enough to avoid collision. This made the reference trajectory stop at this point. To address this problem, a small margin of 0.1 was added when making sampling points. This way, all sample points are certainly visitable from multiple directions. This changed the above output to the one below. The figure shows that less places are accessible to the robot now, but the created paths are certainly collision-free. If a collision-free path exists from the starting point, it will be found. On the left side, it shows that when the robot is faced towards the wall, it can't turn fast enough and so it can't find a path. On the right it shows that when the robot is face parallel to the wall, a path is found. \n",

    "This implementation implements the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithm from lecture slides on probabilistic robotics. It follows the Bayes filter paradigm of estimating the robot's state recursively in the prediction (process model) and update (measurement model) phases. The EKF linearises the non-linear motion model by Jacobian $A$ (slide 53) and blends noisy GPS measurements ($z$) using a linearised measurement matrix $H$, according to the Bayesian approach to deal with uncertainty in state estimation (slides 18–20).\n",
    "\n",
    "The EKF is a good solution here because it's a static environment, with a hard-coded noise level so these are correclty parameterized. Through probabilistic combination of noisy sensor data and control inputs, this application balances model prediction and world observation, demonstrating a practical application of the Bayesian filtering ideas taught in the course. Below is an example output generated by the code above.\n",
